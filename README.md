# Install
It's a simple react app with node in the backend. Installation requires docker, docker-compose and npm:
```
# get the code
curl -L -X GET https://github.com/mickael-kerjean/nuage/archive/master.zip > nuage.zip
unzip nuage.zip && cd nuage-master
# install dependencies and create the actual image
npm run image && npm run start
```
That's it !

# What about my credentials?
Credentials are stored in your browser in a http only cookie encrypted using aes-256-cbc and aren't persistent in the server disk at all.
The "remember me" feature relies on localstorage to store your credentials encrypted using aes-256-cbc.

Note that on the FTP and sFTP, sessions connections aren't destroyed on every request but are reused and killed after 2 minutes. The reasoning is connections are expensive to create and this trick make the entire application feel much much faster for users who tries to navigate.

# Known Issues
- Google Drive: Google Drive lets you add multiple files with the same name in the same directory. You won't be able to see all those in Nuage as we assume that all filenames in a directory are unique.
