# Getting started - Installation
Nuage can be used in different ways:
- Selfhosting ([documentation](https://github.com/mickael-kerjean/nuage/wiki/Installation:-Selhosting)): install it somewhere you have full control (with docker, without docker, on a server or even android)
- Paas ([documentation](https://github.com/mickael-kerjean/nuage/wiki/Installation:-PaaS)): deployment on Heroku or AWS Lambda
- Saas ([documentation](https://github.com/mickael-kerjean/nuage/wiki/Installation:-SaaS)): official instance or private instance fully managed

Using nuage? [Support my work on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/mickaelk) to be notified of new releases, receive communication around security vulnerability (if it were to happen), requires dedicated support, need customisations, extra features, consulting or training.
