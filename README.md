# Core Principles and Ideas

Filestash started as an attempt to solve the "Dropbox problem" by abstracting the storage layer, allowing you to "bring your own backend" by implementing this interface:
```go
type IBackend interface {
	Init(params map[string]string, app *App) (IBackend, error) // constructor
	Ls(path string) ([]os.FileInfo, error)           // list files in a folder
	Cat(path string) (io.ReadCloser, error)          // download a file
	Mkdir(path string) error                         // create a folder
	Rm(path string) error                            // remove something
	Mv(from string, to string) error                 // rename something
	Save(path string, file io.Reader) error          // save a file
	Touch(path string) error                         // create a file
	LoginForm() Form                                 // dynamic form generation for the login
}
```

The software is effectively 2 distinct parts: Core and [Plugins](https://github.com/mickael-kerjean/filestash/tree/master/server/plugin). Plugins act as "Lego blocks" that shape all the opinions on how the file manager operates, such as who can do what and where (aka, the authorisation), how the search features work (e.g., recursive search, full text search, ...), how users are authenticated (e.g., passthrough to the storage layer, LDAP, OIDC, SAML, signed URLs), how the application behaves when opening different file types, etc...

The architecture is designed to enable implementers to build file managers that are fit for purpose. To cite an example, several control panels for elevators in Europe feature QR codes generated by Filestash. Technicians responsible for their maintenance scan these QR codes to access the complete history of the elevator, upload new records, access relevant external resources, and view a banner displaying location specific metadata from the ERP. What would have been a complex custom solution was made possible through the addition of two plugins: one for QR code generation and another for ERP integration. Everything else was off the shelf.
