### Building from source

*Prerequisites*: Git, Make, Node, Go, Glib 2.0

```
# Download the source
git clone https://github.com/mickael-kerjean/filestash
cd filestash

# Install dependencies
npm install # frontend dependencies
make build_init # install the required static libraries
mkdir -p ./dist/data/state/
cp -R config ./dist/data/state/

# Create the build
make build_frontend
make build_backend

# Run the program
./dist/filestash
```

### Tests
Our tests aren't open source. This comes as an attempt to restrict opportunistic forks (see [1](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17006902#17009852) and [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/a54axs/annoucing_jellyfin_a_free_software_fork_of_emby/ebk92iu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)) from creating a stable release without serious commitment and splitting the community in pieces while I'm on holidays. Also the project welcome serious and willing maintainers.
